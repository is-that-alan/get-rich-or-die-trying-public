## The Time Loop Revelation

### The Discovery
With his vast wealth accumulated through AI and robotics ventures, the protagonist encounters a mysterious figure in Hong Kong's underground tech scene - an ancient-looking robot wizard known only as "師父機械人" (Master Robot). This enigmatic being claims to possess temporal manipulation technology, but demands an ultimate price: the protagonist's entire fortune.

### The Robot Wizard's Offer
The 師父機械人, with glowing LED eyes and circuits that seem to pulse with otherworldly energy, speaks in a mixture of Cantonese and binary code: "你想重新開始嗎？Time can be rewound, but the cost is everything you have built. Give me all your wealth - every dollar, every asset, every AI algorithm you own - and I will send you back to optimize your path."

### The Choice
Despite having achieved everything he wanted, the protagonist's perfectionist nature drives him to wonder: "Could I have done it even better? Could I have been even richer, even more successful?" Faced with the robot wizard's offer, he makes the ultimate gamble - transferring his entire digital fortune, his AI companies, his smart robot factories, and all his assets to the mysterious mechanical being.

### The Loop Begins
As the protagonist's bank accounts drain and his empire transfers to the robot wizard, reality begins to shimmer. The 師父機械人's circuits glow brighter as it absorbs the wealth, and with a flash of temporal energy, the protagonist finds himself back in 1990s Hong Kong. But now he retains some knowledge and advantages from his previous life, starting the cycle again as a 文員仔 (office worker) instead of a 外賣仔.

### The Robot Wizard's True Nature
Unknown to the protagonist, the 師父機械人 is actually his future self from a distant timeline - a being who has transcended humanity through countless loops, accumulating wealth and knowledge across infinite iterations. Each time someone pays the price for time travel, the robot wizard grows more powerful, more wealthy, and more capable of manipulating the temporal streams of Hong Kong's economic cycles.

## True Endings (After 4th Loop)

### Benevolent Tycoon (High Positive Karma)
The protagonist finally learns that true wealth comes from lifting others up. He uses his knowledge and resources to help other working-class people escape poverty, breaking the cycle of exploitation. He finds love not through displays of wealth, but through genuine connection and shared values.

### Ruthless Mogul (High Negative Karma)
The protagonist becomes the ultimate exploiter, having learned to manipulate the system perfectly across multiple lifetimes. He achieves maximum wealth but is completely isolated, surrounded only by people who fear or want to use him. He realizes he's become the very type of person who would have exploited his younger self.

### Balanced Businessman (Neutral Karma)
The protagonist finds a middle path - successful but not at the expense of others. He builds sustainable wealth while maintaining relationships. It's not the fairy tale ending, but it's real and honest. He finally understands that the pursuit of wealth was never really about money - it was about feeling worthy of love.

Each era represents different opportunities and challenges for advancement in Hong Kong society, from manufacturing to property to digital economy.

### The Cost of Ambition
The story explores how the pursuit of wealth can consume a person, leading to the loss of the very things that make life meaningful.

### Cyclical Nature of Economic Booms and Busts
Hong Kong's economic history of repeated cycles mirrors the protagonist's personal cycles of success and failure.

### Class and Identity
As the protagonist moves through different social classes, the story examines how wealth changes identity and relationships.

### Time and Regret
The time loop mechanic represents the universal desire to "do it over" and the question of whether we can truly change our fundamental nature.
