# Music System Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Folder Structure
```
music/
â”œâ”€â”€ bgm/                    # Background Music
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ menu/              # Menu screen music
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ battle/            # Battle music
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ map/               # Map/exploration music
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shop/              # Shop ambient music
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ story/             # Story scene music
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ era/               # Era-specific music
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ 1990s/         # 1990s Hong Kong music
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ 2000s/         # 2000s Hong Kong music
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2010s/         # 2010s Hong Kong music
â”œâ”€â”€ sfx/                   # Sound Effects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                # UI interaction sounds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cards/             # Card play sounds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ battle/            # Battle action sounds
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ambient/           # Ambient Hong Kong sounds
â””â”€â”€ dummy/                 # Test/placeholder files
```

### 2. Music System Module (`music.lua`)

**Core Features:**
- Background music management with looping
- Sound effect playback with multiple instances
- Context-aware music switching based on game screen
- Volume controls for music and SFX separately
- Enable/disable toggles for music and SFX
- Graceful handling of missing audio files
- Automatic fallback to dummy tracks for testing

**Key Functions:**
- `Music.init()` - Initialize the music system
- `Music.playBGM(trackName)` - Play background music
- `Music.playSFX(sfxName)` - Play sound effects
- `Music.switchToScreen(screenName, gameState)` - Context-aware music switching
- `Music.setMusicEnabled(enabled)` - Toggle music on/off
- `Music.setSFXEnabled(enabled)` - Toggle SFX on/off
- `Music.test()` - Test the music system and show available files

### 3. Game Integration

**Main Game (`main.lua`) Changes:**
- Music system initialization on game start
- Automatic music switching when changing screens
- Music controls in the main menu (bottom left)
- Sound effects for UI interactions
- Test music button for debugging
- Proper cleanup on game exit

**Screen-Specific Music:**
- **Menu**: Nostalgic Hong Kong theme
- **Battle**: Intense battle music (regular vs boss)
- **Map**: Era-specific music based on current level
- **Shop**: Calm tea restaurant ambience
- **Story**: Dramatic story scene music

### 4. Era-Specific Music System

The music system automatically selects era-appropriate music based on game progression:
- **Levels 1-3**: 1990s manufacturing boom music
- **Levels 4-6**: 2000s property market music
- **Levels 7+**: 2010s digital age music

## How to Test

### 1. Quick Test Setup
1. Add any `.ogg` audio file to `music/dummy/` and rename it to `test_bgm.ogg`
2. Run the game
3. Click "Test Music" button in the main menu
4. Check console output for music system status

### 2. Full Test Setup
1. Add audio files to appropriate folders (see folder README files)
2. Use the music controls in the main menu (bottom left)
3. Navigate between different game screens to test music switching
4. Check console for detailed music system feedback

### 3. Console Output
The music system provides detailed console output:
- `â™ª Playing BGM: [track_name]` - Music started
- `ðŸ”Š Playing SFX: [sfx_name]` - Sound effect played
- `âœ“ Preloaded music track: [track_name]` - File loaded successfully
- `âœ— Failed to load: [file_path]` - File not found

## Current Status

### âœ… Implemented
- Complete music system architecture
- Folder structure with documentation
- Context-aware music switching
- Volume and enable/disable controls
- UI integration with main menu
- Error handling and fallback systems
- Test functionality

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Audio Files
The system is fully functional and ready for audio files. You just need to:
1. Add `.ogg` audio files to the appropriate folders
2. Follow the naming conventions in the README files
3. Test with the built-in music system test

### ðŸŽµ Recommended Next Steps
1. **Add test audio**: Place any `.ogg` file as `music/dummy/test_bgm.ogg` to test immediately
2. **Find Hong Kong music**: Look for Cantonese pop, traditional Chinese instruments, or Hong Kong ambient sounds
3. **Create/commission music**: For authentic Hong Kong atmosphere
4. **Add sound effects**: UI clicks, card sounds, battle effects
5. **Fine-tune volumes**: Adjust volume levels for optimal game experience

## Technical Notes

### File Format Support
- **Primary**: `.ogg` (best performance in LÃ–VE2D)
- **Supported**: `.mp3`, `.wav`
- **Recommendation**: Convert all files to `.ogg` for consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Background music uses "stream" loading (memory efficient)
- Sound effects use "static" loading (faster playback)
- Audio sources are cached after first load
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Hong Kong Cultural Integration
- Era-specific music reflects Hong Kong's economic evolution
- Context-aware switching maintains immersion
- Cultural authenticity through appropriate music selection

## Usage Examples

```lua
-- Play specific background music
Music.playBGM("battle")

-- Play sound effect
Music.playSFX("card_play")

-- Switch music based on screen
Music.switchToScreen("map", gameState)

-- Control volume
Music.setMusicVolume(0.5)  -- 50% volume

-- Toggle music
Music.setMusicEnabled(false)
```
