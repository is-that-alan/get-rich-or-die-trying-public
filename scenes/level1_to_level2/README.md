# Level 1 to Level 2 Transition Scene

This scene depicts the transition between Level 1 and Level 2, showing the end of one chapter and the beginning of the next.

## Scene Content (Comic Panels)

Add 4-8 sequential images to tell the transition story:

1. **01_ending.png** - The conclusion of Level 1
2. **02_transition.png** - The change/shift happening
3. **03_new_beginning.png** - Setting up Level 2
4. **04_onwards.png** - Moving forward into the new chapter
5. **[optional additional panels]**

## Visual Guidelines

- **Comic book style panels** - Clear, readable comic format
- **Hong Kong setting** - Authentic Hong Kong locations and atmosphere
- **Sequential storytelling** - Each panel should flow naturally to the next
- **Character development** - Show growth/change in the protagonist
- **Thematic transition** - Visual elements that bridge the two levels

## Technical Requirements

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Naming**: Sequential (01.png, 02.png, etc.)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 recommended for best display
- **Resolution**: Any size (will be scaled automatically)

This scene automatically triggers when transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2 and advances the player's progress when completed.
